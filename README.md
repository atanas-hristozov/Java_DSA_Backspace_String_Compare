Backspace String Compare
This Java code contains a Solution class with a method to compare two strings after processing a specific character, the backspace (#).

Problem Statement
Given two strings s and t, the goal is to determine if after applying backspace rules, the resulting strings are equal.

Method
The backspaceCompare method within the Solution class takes two strings s and t as input and returns true if the strings are equal after applying the backspace rules, otherwise false.

Code Explanation
The Solution class contains the following methods:

backspaceCompare

public boolean backspaceCompare(String s, String t) {
    return processBackspace(s).equals(processBackspace(t));
}
Input: Two strings, s and t.
Output: true if the processed strings are equal, otherwise false.
Description: Utilizes the processBackspace method to process both strings according to backspace rules and compares the resulting strings.

java
Copy code
private String processBackspace(String s){
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
    while(sb.indexOf("#")>=0){
        if(sb.indexOf("#") == 0)
            sb.deleteCharAt(0);
        else
            sb.delete(sb.indexOf("#")-1, sb.indexOf("#")+1);
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
Input: A string s.
Output: Processed string after applying backspace rules.
Description: Processes the input string by identifying and removing characters preceding the backspace character #.
Usage
Create an instance of the Solution class.
Call the backspaceCompare method with two strings as arguments to check if they are equal after applying backspace rules.
Example:


Solution solution = new Solution();
String s = "ab#c";
String t = "ad#c";
boolean result = solution.backspaceCompare(s, t); // result will be true
